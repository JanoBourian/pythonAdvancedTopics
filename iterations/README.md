# Iterations and Iterators

In this topic I'm going to write some example of iterators and I'm going to put the basis for the complex and extensive knowledge about the modern way to programming in python and extend our knowledge.

## main.py

In this code I put an example about some class that is using *__iter__\(\)* and *__next__\(\)* methods

## fibonacci.py

## factorial.py

Not really a factorial, something like that.
