# Testing

Testing is a complex topic because testing has a several ways to do it. Testing starts with a docstring, pydoc, doctest, unittest and more complex stuff like pytest, selenium and other more. In this documentation the way to attack these topics will be to start with the most basic: docstring, and after that we can advance to pydoc/doctest and finally unittest.

After Unittest the next steps is take a course of read a lot of documentation about advanced topics like pytest, automated tests or integration test, in a particular case we need to learn about Flask test (or other framework).
